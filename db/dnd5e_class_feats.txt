<h3>Preparing and Casting Spells</h3>
<p>You prepare the list of wizrd spells that are available for you to cast. To do so, choose a number of wizard spells from your spellbook equal to <strong> your Intelligence modifier + your wizard level( minimum of one spell  )</strong>. The spells must be of a level for which you have spel slots.</p> 
<p> You can change your list of prepared spells when you finish a long rest. Preparing a new list of wizard spells requires time spent studying your spellbook and memorizing the incantations and gestures you must make to cast the spell: at least 1 minute per spell level for each spell on your list.  </p>
<h3>Spellcasting Ability</h3>
<p>Intelligence is your spellcasting ability for wizard spells.</p>
<p><strong>Spell save DC =</strong> 8 + you proficiency bonus + your intelligence modifier</p>
<p><strong>Spell attack modifier =</strong> you proficiency bonus + your intelligence modifier</p>
<h3>Ritual Casting</h3>
<p>You can cast a wizard spell as a ritual if that spell has the ritual tag and you have the spell in your spellbook. You dont need to have the spell prepared.</p>
<h3>Spellcasting focus</h3>
<p>You can use an arcane focus as a spellcasting focus for your wizard spells.</p>
<h3>Learning Spells of 1st Level and Higher</h3>
<p>Each time you gain a wizard level, you can add two wizard spells of your choice to your spellbook. Each of these spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots.</p>
**wizard$1$Your Spellbook$<p> The spells that you add to your spellbook as you gain levels reflect the arcane research you conduct on your own, as well as intellectual breakthroughs ou have had about the nature of the multiverse. You might find other spells during your adventures. You could discover a spell recorded on a scroll in an evil wizard's chest, for example, or ina dusty tome in an ancient library.</p>
<p><strong>Copying a Spell into the Book.</strong> When you find a wizard spell of 1st level or higher, you can add it to your spellbook if it is of a level for which you have spell slots and if you can spare the time to decipher and copy it.</p>
<p> Copying a spell into your spelbook invlolves reproducing the basic for of the spell, then diciphering the unique system of notation used by the wizard who wrot it. You must practice the spell until you understand the sounds or gestures required, then transcribe it into your spellbook using your own notation.</p>
<p>For each leel of the spell, the process takes 2 hours and costs 50 gp. The cost represents material components you expend as you expirement with the spell to master it, as well as the fine inks you need to record it. Once you have spent this time and money, can prepare the spell just like your other spells. </p>
<p><strong>Replacing the Book.</strong> You can copy a spell from your own spellbook into another book - for example, if you want to make a backup copy of our spellbook. This is just like copying a new spell into your spellbook, but fasterand easier, since you understand your own notation and already know how to cast the spell. You need spend only 1 hour and 10 gp for each level of the copied spell.</p>
<p>If you lose your spellbook, you can use the same procedure to transcribe the spells that you have prepared into a new spellbook. Filling out the remainer of you spellbook requires you to find new spells to do so, as normal. For this reason, many wizards keep backup spellbooks in a safe place.</p>
<p><strong>The Book's Appearance.</strong> Your spellbook is a unique compilation of spells, with its own decorative flourishes and margin notes. It might be a plain, functional leather volume that your received as a gift from your master, a finely bound gilt-edged tome you found in an ancient library, or even a loose collection of notes scrounged together after you lost your previous spellbook in a mishap.</p>
**wizard$2$arcane recovery$<p>Once per day when you finish a short rest, you can choose expended spell slots to recover. The spell slots can have a combined level that is equal to or less than half your wizard level( rounded up ), and none of the slots can be 6th level or higher.</p>
**wizard$18$spell mastery$<p>Choosd a 1st-level wizard spell and a 2nd-level wizard spell that are in your spellbook. You can cast those spells at their lowest level without expending a spell slot when you have them prepared. If you want to cast either spell at a higher level, you must expend a spell slot as normal.</p>
<p>By spending 8 hours in study, you can exchange one or both of the spells you chose for different spells of the same levels.</p>
**wizard$20$signature spells$<p>Choose two 3rd-level wizard spells in your spellbook as your signature spells. You always have these spells prepared, they don't count against the number of spells you have prepared, and you can cast each of them once at 3rd-level without expending a spell slot. When you do so, you can't do so again until you finish a short or long rest.</p>
<p>If you want to cast either spell at a higher level, you must expend a spell slot as normal.</p>
