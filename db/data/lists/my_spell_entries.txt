You can permanently eliminate all memory of the event,  allow the target to recall the event with perfect clarity and exacting detail, change its memory of the details of the event, or create memory of some other event.</p>
<p> You must speak to the taget to describe how its memories are affected, and it must be able to understand your language for the modified memories to take root. Its mind fills in any gaps in the details of your description. If the spell ends before you have finished describing the modified memories, the creatures's memory isn;t altered. Otherwise, the modified memories take hold when the spell ends.</p>
<p>A modified memory doesn't necesarily affect how a creature behaves, particularly if the memory contradicts th creature's natural inclinations, alignment, or beliefs, an illogical modified memory, such as implanting a memory of how much the creature enjoyed dousing itself in acid, is dismissed, perhaps as a bad dream. The DM might deeem a modified memory too nonsensical to affect a creature in a significant manner.</p>
<p>A remove curse or greater restoration spell cast on the target restores the creature's true memory.</p>
<p><strong>At Higher Levels.</strong> If you cast this spell using a spell slot of 6th level or higher, you can alter the target's memories of an event that took place up to 7 days ago (6th level), 30 days ago(7th level), 1 year ago(8th level), or any time in the creature's past(9th level).</p>

WHen a creature enters the spell's area for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there, it is engulfed in ghostly flames that cause searing pain, and i must make a constitution saving throw. It takes 2d10 radiant damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.</p>
<p>A shapechanger makes its saving throw with disadvantage. If it fails, it also instantly reverts to its original form. and can't assume a different form until it leaves the spell's light.</p>
<p> On each of your turns after you cast this spell, you can use an action to move the beam 60 feet in any direction.</p>
<p><strong>At Higher Levels.</strong> When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, the damage increases by 1d10 for each slot level above 2nd.</p>
**Mordenkainen's Faithful Hound$4th-level$conjuration$1 action$30 feet$V,S,M(a tiny silver whistle, a piece of bone and a thread_
)$8 hours$

<p> The hound is invisible to all creatures except you and can't be harmed. WHen a small or larger creature comes within 30 feet of it without first speaking the password that you specify when you cast this spell, the hound starts arking loudly. The hound sees invisible creatures and can see into the Ethereal Plane. It ignores illusions.</p>
<p>At the start of each of your turns, the hound attempts to bite one creature within 5 feet of it that is hostile to you. the hound's attack bonus is equal to your spellcasting ability modifier + your proficiency bonus. On a hit, it deals 4d8 piercing damage.</p>

<p>When you cast the spell, you decide what sort of security the spell provides, choosing any or all of the following properties:</p>
<p>
	<ul>
		<li>Sound can't pass through the barrier at the edge of the warded area</li>
		<li>The barrier of the warded area appears dark and foggy, preventing vision(including darkvision) through it.</li>
		<li>Sensors craeted by divination spells can't appear inside the protected area or pass through the barrier at its perimeter</li>
		<li>Creatures in the area can't be targeted by divination spells.</li>
		<li>Nothing can teleport into or out of the warded area.</li>
		<li>Planar travel is blocked within the warded area.</li>
	</ul>
</p>
<p>Casting this spell on the same spot every ay for a year makes this effect permanent.</p>
<p><strong>At Higher Levels.</strong> When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 5th level or higher, you can increase the size of the cube by 100 feet for each slot level beyond 4th. Thuse you could protect a cube that can be up to 200 feet on one side by using a spell slot of 5th level.</p>
**Move Earth$6th-level$transmutation$1 action$120 feet$V,S,M(an iron blade and a small bag containing a mixture of souls-clay,loam, and sand)$Concentration, up to 2 hours$
<p>Choose an area of terrain no larger than 40 feet on a side within range. You can reshape dirt, sand, or clay in the area in any manner you choose for the duration. You can raise or lower the area's elevation, create or fill in a trench, erect or flatten a wall, or form a pillar. The extent of any such changes can't exceed half the area's largest dimension. So. if you affect a 40-foot square, you can create a pillar up to 20 feet hight, raise or lower the square's elevation by up to 20 feet, dig a trench up to 20 feet deep, and so on. It takes 10 minutes for these changes to complete.</p>
<p>At the end of every 10 minutes you spend concentrating on the spell, you can choose a new area of terrain to affect.</p>
<p>Because the terrain's transformation occurs slowly, creatures in the area can't usually be trapped or injured by the ground's movement.</p>
<p>This spell can't manipulate natural stone or stone contruction. rocks and structures shift to accomadate the new terrain. If the way you shape the terrain would make a structure unstable, it might collapse.</p>
<p>Similarly, this spell doesn't directly affect plant growth. The moved earth carries any plants along with it.</p>

**Otiluke's Freezing Sphere$6th-level$evocation$1 action$300 feet$V,S,M(a small crystal sphere)$Instantaneous$
<p>A frigid globe of cold energy streaks from your fingertips to a point of your choice within range, where it explodes in a 60-foot-radius. Each creature within the area must make a constitution saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 10d6 cold damage. On a successful save, it takes half as much damage.</p>
<p>If the globe strikes a body of water or a liquid that is a principally water(not including water-based creatures), it freezes the liquid to a depth of 6 inches over an area 30 feet square. This ice lasts for 1 minute. Creatures that were swimming on the surface of frozen water are trapped in the ice. A trapped creature can use an action to make a strength check against your spell save DC to break free.</p>
<p>You can refrain from firing the globe after completing the spell, if you wish. A small globe about the size of a sling stone, cool to the touch, appears in your hamd. At any time, you or a creauture you give the globe to can throw the globe(to a range of 40 feet) or hurl it with asling(to the sling's normal range). it shatters on impact, with the same effect as the normal casting of the spell. You can also set the globe down without shattering it. After 1 minute, if the globe hasn't already shattered, it explodes.</p>

**Otiluke's Resilient Sphere$4th-level$evocation$1 action$30 feet$V,S,M(a hemispherical piece of clear crystal and a matching hemispherical piece of gum arabic)$Concentration, up to 1 minute$
<p>A sphere of shimmering force encloses a creature or object of large size or smaller within range. An unwilling creature must make a dexterity saving trow. On a failed save, the creature is enclosed for the duration.</p>
<p>Nothing-not physical objects, energy or other spell effect-can pass through the barrier, in or out, though a creature in the sphere can breathe there. The sphere is immune to all damage, and a creature or object inside can't be damaged by attacks or effects originating from outside, nor can a creature inside the sphere damage anything outside it.</p>
<p>The sphere is weightless and just large enough to contain the creature or object inside. An enclosed creature can use its action to push against the sphere's walls and thus roll the sphere at up to half the creature's speed. Similarly, the globe can be picked up and moved by other creatures.</p>
<p>A disintegrate spell targeting the globe destroys it without harming anything inside it.</p>
**Otto's Irresistible Dance$6th-level$enchantment$1 action$30 feet$V$Concentration, up to 1 minute$
<p>Choose one creature that you can see within range. The target begins a comic dance in place: shuffling, tapping its feet, and capering for the duration. Creatures that can't be charmed are immune to this spell.</p>
<p>A dancing creature must use all its movement to dance without leaving its space and has disadvantage on dexterity sving throws and attack rolls. While the target is affected by this spell, other creatures have advantage on attack rolls against it. As an action, a dancing creature makes a wisdom saving throw to regain control of itself. On a successful sve, the spell ends.</p>
**Pass without Trace$2nd-level$abjuration$1 action$Self$V,S,M(ashes from a burned leaf of mistletoe and a sprig of spruce)$Concentration, up to 1 hour$
<p>A veil of shadows and silence radiates from you, masking you and your companions from etection. For the duration, each creature you choose within 30 feet of you(including you)has a +10 bonus to dexterity(stealth) checks and can't be tracked except by magical means. A creature that receives this bonus leave behind no tracks or other traces of its passage.</p>
**Passwall$5th-level$transmutation$1 action$30 feet$V,S,M(a pinch of sesame seeds)$1 hour$
<p>A passage appears at a point of your choice that you can see on a wooden, plaster, or stone surface(such as a wall, a ceiling, or a floor) within range, and lasts for the duration. You choose the opening's dimensions: up to 5 feet wide, 8 feet tall, and 20 feet deep. The passage creates no instability in a structure surrounding it.</p>
<p>When the opening disappears, any creatures or objects still in the passage created by the spell are safely ejected to an unoccupied sapce nearest to the surface on which you cast the spell.</p>
**Phantasmal Force$2nd-level$illusion$1 action$60 feet$V,S,M(a bit of fleece)$Concentration, up to 1 minute$
<p>You craft an illusion that takes root in the mind of a creature that you can see within range. The target must make an intelligence saving throw. On a failed save, you create a phantasmal object, creature or other visible phenomenon of your choice that is no larger than a 10-foot cube and that is perceivable only to the target for the duration. This spell has no effect on undead or constructs.</p>
<p>The phantasm includes sound, temperature, and other stimuli, also evident only to the creature.</p>
<p>The target can use its action to examine the phantasm with an intelligence(investigation) check against your spell save DC. If the check succeeds,the target realizes that the phantasm is an illusion, and the spell ends.</p>
<p>While a target is affected by the spell,  the target treats the phantasm as if it were real. THe target rationalizes any illogical outcomes from interacting with the phantasm. For example, a target attempting to walk across a phantasmal bridge that spans a chasm falls once it steps onto the bridge. If the target survives the fall, it still believes that the bridge exists and comes up with some other explanation for its fall- it was pushed, it slipped, or a strong wind might have knocked it off.</p>
<p>An affected target is so convinced of he phantasm's reality that it can even take dmage from the illusion. A phantasm created to appear as a creature can attack the target. Similarly, a phantasm created to appear as fire, a pool of acid, or lava can burn the target. Each round on your turn, the phantasm can deal 1d6 psychic damage to the target if it is in the phantasm's area or within 5 feet of the phantasm, provided that the illusion is of a creature or hazard that could logically deal damage, such as by attacking. The target percieves the damage as a type appropriate to the illusion.</p>
**Phantasmal Killer$4th-level$illusion$1 action$120 feet$V,S$Concentration, up to 1 minute$
<p>You tap into the nightmares of a creature you can see within range and create an illusory manifestation of its deepest fears, visible only to that creature. The target must make a wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the target becomes frightened for the duration. At the start of each of the target;s turns before the spell ends, the target must succeed on a wisdom saving throw or take 4d10 psychic damage. On a successful save, the spell ends.</p>
<p><strong>At Higher Levels.</strong> When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 5th level hor higher, the damage increases by 1d10 for each slot level above 4th.</p>
**Planar Ally$6th-level$conjuration$10 minutes$60 feet$V,S$Instantaneous$
<p>You beseech an otherworldly entity for aid. The being must be known to you: a god, a primordial, a demon prince, or some other being of cosmic power. That entity sends a celestial, an elemental, or a fiend loyal to it to aid you, making the creature appear in an unoccupied space within range, If you know a specific creature's name, you can speak that name when  when you cast this spell to request that creature, though you might get a different creature anyway(DM's choice).</p>
<p>When the creature appears, it is under no compulsion to behave in any particular way. You can ask the creature to perform a service in exchange for payment, but it isn't obliged to do so. The requested task could range from simple(fly us across the chasm, or help us fight a batte) to complext(spy on our enemies, or protect us during our foray into the dungeon). You must be able to communicate with the creature to bargain for its services.</p>
<p>Payment can take a variey of forms. A celestial might require a sizable donation of gold or magic items to an allied temple, while a fiend might demand a living sacrifice or gift of treasure. Some creatures might exchange their service for a quest undertaken by you.</p>
<p>As a rule of thumb, a task that can be measured in minutes reuires a payment worth 100gp per minute. A task mersured in hours requires 1,000gp per hour. And a task measured in days(up to 10 days) requires 10,000gp per day. The DM can adjust adjust these payments based on the circumstances under which you cast the spell. If the task is aligned with the creature's ethos, the payment might be halved or even waived. Nonhazardous tasks typically require only half the suggested payment, while especially dangerous takss might require a greater gift. Creatures rarely accept tasks that seem suicidal.</p>
<p>After the creature completes the task or when the agreed-upon duration of service expires, the creature returns to its home plane after reporting back to you, if appropriate to the task and if possible. If you are unable to agree on a price for the creature's service, the creature immediately returns to its home plane.</p>
<p>A creature enlisted to join your group counts as a member of it, receiving a full share of experience points awarded.</p>
**Planar Binding$5th-level$abjuration$1 hour$60 feet$V,S,M(a jewel worth at leas 1,000gp, which the spell consumes)$24 hours$
<p>With this spell, you attempt to bind a celestial, and elemental, a fey, or a fiend, to your service. The creature must be within range for the entire casting of the spell.(Typically, the creature is first sumoned into the center of an inverted magic circle in order to keep it trapped while this spell is cast.) At the completion of the casting. the target must make a charisma saving throw. On a failed save, it is bound to serve you for the duration. If the creature was summoned or created by another spell, that spell's duration is extended to match the duration of this spell.</p>
<p>A bound creature must follow your instructions to the best of its ability. You must follow your instructions to the best of its ability. You might command the creature to accompany you on an adventure, to guard a location, or to deliver a message. The creature obeys the letter of your instructions, but if the creature is hostile to you, it strives to twist your words to achieve its own objectives. If the creature carries out your instructions completely before the spell ends, it travels to you to report this fact if you are on the same plane of existence. If you are on a different plane of existence, it returns to the plce where you bound it and remains there until the spell ends.</p>
<p><strong>At Higher Levels.</strong> When you cast this spell using a spell slot of a higher level, the duration increases to 10 days with 6th-level slot, to 30 days with a 7th-level slot, to 180 days with an 8th-level slot, and to a year and a day with a 9th-level spell slot.</p>
**Polymorph$4th-level$transmutation$1 action$60 feet$V,S,M(a caterpillar cocoon)$Concentration, up to 1 hour$
<p>This spell transforms a creature that you can see within range into a new form. An unwilling creature must make a wisdom saving throw to avoid the effet. A shapechanger automatically succeeds on this saving throw.</p>
<p>The transformation lasts for the duration, or until the target drops to 0 hit points or dies. The new form can be any beast whose challenge rating is equal to or less than the target's(or the target's level, if it doesn't have a challenge rating). The target's game statistics, including mental ability scores, are replaced by the statistics of the chosen beast. It retains its alignment and personality.<p>
<p> The target assumes the hit points of its new form. WHen it reverts to its normal form, the creature returns to the number of hit points it had before it transformed. If it reverts to its normal form, the normal form the creature returns to the number of hit points it ahd before it transformed. If it reverts as a result tof dropping to 0 hit points, any excess damage carries over to its normal form. As long as the excess damage doesn't reduce the creature's normal form to 0 hit points, it isn't knocked unconscious.</p>
<p>The creature is limited in the actions it can perform by the nature of its new form, and it can;t speak, cast spells or take any other action that requires hands or speech.</p>
<p>The target's gear melds into the new form. The creature is limited in the actions it can perform by the nature of its new form, and it can't speak, cast spells, or take any other action that requires hands or speech.</p>
<p>The target's gear melds into the new form. THe creature can't activate, use, wield or otherwise benefit from any of its equipment.</p>
**Prismatic Wall$9th-level$abjuration$1 action$60 feet$V,S$10 minutes$
<p>A shimmering, multicolored plane of light forms a vertical opaque wall-up to 90 feet long, 30 feet high, and 1 inch thick-centered on a point you can see within range. Alternatively, you can shape the wall into a sphere up to 30 feet in diameter centered on a point you choose within range. The wall remains in place for the duration. If you position the wall so that it passes through a space occupied by a creature, the spell fails, and our action and the spell slot are wasted.</p>
<p> The wall sheds bright light out to a range of 100 feet and dim light for an additional 100 feet. You and creatures you designate at the time you cast the spell can pass through and remain near the wall without harm. If anoter creature that can see the wall moves to within 20 feet of it or starts its turn there, the creature must succeed on a constitution saving throw or become blinded for 1 minute. </p>
<p>The wall consists of seven layers, each with a different color. When a creature attempts to reach into or pass through the wall, it does sos one layer at a time through all the wall's layers. As it passes or reaches through each layer, the creature must make a dexterity saving throw or be affected by that layer's properties as a described below.</p>
<p>The wall can be destroyed, also one layer at a time, in order from red to violet, by means specific to each layer. Once a layer is destroyed, it remains so for the duration of the spell. A rod of cancellatin destroys a prismatic wall, but an antimagic field has no effect on it.</p>
<p><strong>1.Red.</strong> The creature takes 10d6 fire damage on a failed sve, or half as much damage on a successful one. While this layer is in place, nonmagical ranged attacks can't pass through the wall. The layer can be destroyed b dealing at least 25 cold damage to it.</p>
<p><strong>2.Orange.</strong> The creature takes 10d6 acid damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. While this layer is in place, magical ranged attacks can't pass through the wall. THe layer is destroyed by a strong wind.</p>
<p><strong>3.Yellow.</strong> The creature takes 10d6 lightning dmage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. This layer can be destroyed by dealing at least 60 force damage to it.</p>
<p><strong>4.Green.</strong> The creature takes 10d6 poison damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a failed save or half as much damage on successful one. While this layer is in palce, magical ranged attacks can't pass through the wall. This layer can be destroyed by dealing at least 60 force damage</p>
<p><strong>5.Blue.</strong> The creature takes 10d6 cold damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. This layer can be destroyed by dealing at least 25 fire damage to it.</p>
<p><strong>6.Indigo.</strong> On a failed save, the creature is restrained. It must then make a constitution saving throw at the end of each of its turns. If it successfully saves three times, the spell ends. If it fails its save three times, it permanently turns to stone and is subjected to the petrified condition. The successes and dailures don't need to be consecutive; keep track of both until the creature collects three of a kind.</p>
<p>While this layer in in place, spells can't be cast through the wall. THe layer is destroyed by bright light shed by a daylight spell or a similar spell of equal or higher level.</p>
<p><strong>7.Violet.</strong> On a failed save, the creature is blinded. It must then make a wisdom saving throw at the start of your next turn. A successful save ends the blindness. If it fails that save, the creature is transported to another palne of the DM's choosing and is no longer blinded.(Typically, a creature that is on a plane that isn't its home plane is banished home, while other creatures are usually cast into the Astral or Ethereal planes.) This layer is destroyed by a dispel magic spell or a similar spell of equal or higher level that can end spells and magical effects.</p>
**Programmed Illusion$6th-level$illusion$1 action$120 feet$V,S,M(a bit of fleece and jade dust worth at least 25 gp)$Until dispelled$
<p>You create an illusion of an object, a creature, or some other visivle phenomenon within range that activate when a specific condition occurs. The illusion is imperceptible until then. It must be no larger than than a 30-foot cube, and you decide when you cast the spell how the illusion behaves and what sounds it makes. This scripted performance can last up to 5 minutes</p>
<p>When the condition you specify occurs, the illusion springs into existence and performs in the manner you described. Once the illusion finishes performing, it disappears and remains dormant for 10 minutes. After this time, the illusion can be activated again.</p>
<p>The triggering condition can be as generalor as detailed as you like, though it must be based on visual or audible conditions that occur within 30 feet of the area. For example you could create an illusion of yourself to appear and warn off others who attempt ot open a trapped door or you could set the illusion to trigger only when a creature says the correct word or phrase</p>
<p>Physical interaction with the image reveals it to be an illusion, because things can pass through it. A creature that uses its action to examine the image can determine that it is an illusion with a successful intelligence(investigation) check gainst your spell save DC. If a creature discerns the illusion for what it is, the creature can see through the image, and any noise it makes sounds hollow to the creature.</p>
**Protection from Poison$2nd-level$abjuration$1 action$Touch$V,S$1 hour$
<p>You touch a creature. If it is poisoned, you neutralize the poison. If more than ne poison afflicts the target, you neutralize one poison that you know is present, or you neutralize one at random.</p>
<p> For the duration, the target has advantage on saving throws against being poisoned, and it has resistance to poison damage</p>
**Raise Dead$5th-level$necromancy$1 hour$Touch$V,S,M(a diamond worth at least 500 gp, which the spell consumes)$Instantaneous$
<p>You return a dead creature you touch to life, provided that it has been dead no longer than 10 days.If the creature's soul is both willing and at liberty to rejoin the body, the creature returns to life with 1 hit point.</p>
<p>This spell also netralizes any poisons and cures nonmagical diseases that affected the creature at the time it died. This spell doesn't, however, remove magical diseases, curses, or similar effects; if these aren't first removed prior to casting the spell, they take effect when the creature returns when the creature returns to life. The spell can't return an undead creature to life</p>
<p>This spell closes all mortal wounds, but it doesn't restore missing body parts. If the creature is lacking body parts or organs integral for its survival-its head, for instance-the spell automatically fails.</p>
<p>Coming back from the dead is an ordeal. The target takes a -4 penalty to all attack rolls, saving throws, and ability checks. Every time the target finishes a long rest, the penalty is reduced by 1 until it disappears.</p>
**Rary's Telepathic Bond$5th-level$divination$1 action$30 feet$V,S,M(pieces of eggshell from two different kinds of creatures)$1 hour$
<p>You forge a telepathic link among up to eight willing creatures of your choice within range, psychically linking each creature to all the others for the duration. Creatures with intelligence scores of 2 or less aren't affected by this spell.</p>
Until the spell ends, the targets can communicate telepathically through the bond whether or not they have a common language. The communication is possible over any distance, though it can't extend to other planes of existence</p>
**Ray of Enfeeblement$2nd-level$necromancy$1 action$60 feet$V,S$Concentration, up to 1 minute$
<p>A black beam of enrvating enrgy springs from your finger toward a creature within range. Make a ranged spell attack against the target. On a hit, the target deals only half damage with weapon attacks that use strength until the spell ends.</p>

**Reincarnate$5th-level$transmutation$1 hour$Touch$V,S,M(rare oils and unguents worth at least 1,000 gp, which the spell consumes)$Instantaneous$
<p> You touch a dead humanoid or a piece of a dead humanoid. Provided that the creature has been dead no longer than 10 days, the spell forms a new adult body for it and then calls the soul to enter that body.  If the target's soul isn't free or willing to do so, the spell fails.</p>
<p>The magic fashions a new body for the creature to inhabit, which likely causes the creature's race to change. The DM rolls a d100 and consults the following table to determina what form the creature takes when restored to life, or the DM chooses a form</p>
